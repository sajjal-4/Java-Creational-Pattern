# Java Design Patterns: Factory and Singleton

This repository contains simple Java examples demonstrating the **Factory** and **Singleton** design patterns. These examples are intended for educational purposes and aim to provide a clear, concise understanding of these fundamental creational patterns.

## Patterns Included

*   **Factory Pattern:** This pattern provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. The examples demonstrate how to create different types of notifications (Email, SMS, Push) and shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Square) using a Factory.

*   **Singleton Pattern:** This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. The examples demonstrate this with a simple Singleton class and a ConfigurationManager.

## Usage

These examples are designed to be easy to run and understand.  You can use any Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions) or the command line to compile and run the code.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository URL>
    ```

    (Replace `<repository URL>` with the actual URL of your repository)

2.  **Open the project in your IDE or navigate to the project directory in your terminal.**

3.  **Compile and Run:**

    *   **Using an IDE:**  Open the project in your IDE and run the `main` method in the demo class for each pattern (e.g., `FactoryPatternDemoo.java` or `SingletonPatternDemoo.java`).

    *   **Using the Command Line:**
        *   Navigate to the directory containing the Java files you want to run.
        *   Compile: `javac <package name>/<ClassName>.java` (e.g., `javac factorypatterndemoo/FactoryPatternDemoo.java`)
        *   Run: `java <package name>.<ClassName>` (e.g., `java factorypatterndemoo.FactoryPatternDemoo`)
